* My nix setup

Some day I may document this, but for now glhf

note to myself, setting up a new machine that has the ablity to deploy will require you to add your age key to secrets/secret.key

After that, you may need to setup git-agecrypt, but you may be able to just run ~git-agecrypt config add -r "<ssh public key>" -p assests/Berkeley_Mono.zip~ and also add the same ssh key to known/authorised hosts ect ect
